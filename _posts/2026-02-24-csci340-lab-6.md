### User Stories
1. As a customer, I want to know the quantities of each item available so that I know how much I can buy.
    - This would take multiple hours to implement. We would have to manually put the quantities of each item into the website after taking inventory, and then continuously update them as items are purchased. Manually putting in the quantities may take a while.
    - This goes with the next two user stories, as we will need substitutions if items are out of stock.
2. As an admin, I want users to know when items are out of stock so that they don't purchase them.
    - This goes with the next story. We want to show customers substitution options in these situations as well.
    - Once we make all quantities available to online customers, we wouldn't need to implement this again.
3. As a customer, I want to have a few substitution options for items out of stock so that I can pick the next best thing.
    - This would take multiple hours to implement. Every item can have a corresponding list of potential substitutions, which we would have to enter into the system.
4. As an admin, I want to be able to update the pices of items as they change so that online customers pay the same amount as in-person customers.
    - This would take a few hours to implement. After setting the original prices (which would take up most of the time), we just need to allow the admin access to adjust prices.
5. As a customer, I want to be able to choose the time and date that I pick my order up so that I can fit grocery shopping around my schedule.
    - This would likely take under an hour to implement. We just set it up so that anytime an order is placed, the customer is prompted for the time and date that they would like to pick it up.
